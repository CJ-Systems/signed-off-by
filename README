Do you want explicit licensing and publishing permissions for each
patch you incorperate into your project?  Do you miss the simplicity
of Signed-off-by tags you use when developing the Linux kernel and
Git?  This repository extracts the Developer Certificate of Origin and
Signed-off-by documentation from both projects, and presents them in a
project-agnostic manner.  To incorporate into your own project,

1. Merge the documentation into your project:

    $ git remote add s-o-b git://tremily.us/signed-off-by.git
    $ git merge s-o-b/signed-off-by

2. Tell your developers by pointing to
   `Documentation/SubmittingPatches` from your `README` or
   `CONTRIBUTING` documentation and sending a message to your mailing
   list.

3. Prosper.
